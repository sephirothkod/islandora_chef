# lsyncd Cookbook

The lsyncd cookbook installs lsyncd, creates a basic config, and starts the
service. Additionally, it exposes the lsyncd_target resource to easily add sync
configs.

Through some ugly Lua hackery, the main config, `/etc/lsyncd/lsyncd.conf.lua`,
is setup such that it will include all sync configs in `/etc/lsyncd/conf.d/`.
The lsyncd_target resource pretty much just creates the configs in
`/etc/lsyncd/conf.d/`.

The basis for this cookbook came from
[bflad's lsyncd cookbook](https://github.com/bflad/chef-lsyncd).

## Requirements

- Chef 11 or greater

Tested on:

- Debian 7.x (Wheezy)
- Ubuntu 12.04
- Ubuntu 14.04
- CentOS 6.5
- CentOS 7.0

## Resources/Providers

### lsyncd_target

#### Actions

- `:create` - creates a sync config
- `:delete` - deletes the sync config

#### Parameters

- `mode` - lsyncd sync mode. Defaults to `rsync`
- `source` - source directory. Required
- `target` - target directory to sync files to. Required
- `user` - User name to use when syncing content. Optional, will assume root if a user name is not provided.
- `host` - IP or hostname of remote host. Required for remote syncing with the `rsync` or `rsyncssh` modes.
- `rsync_opts` - list of rsync options
- `exclude` - list of [exclusions](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd/wiki/Lsyncd%202.1.x%20%E2%80%96%20Layer%204%20Config%20%E2%80%96%20Default%20Behavior#exclusions)
- `exclude_from` - path to file containing exclusions

#### Example

Sync a directory to another local directory:

```ruby
include_recipe 'lsyncd'

lsyncd_target 'foo' do
  source '/tmp/foo'
  target '/tmp/bar'
  notifies :restart, 'service[lsyncd]', :delayed
end
```

You can also do remote rsync by specifying `rsync` or `rsyncssh` for the mode:

```ruby
include_recipe 'lsyncd'

lsyncd_target 'foo' do
  host 'test'
  source '/tmp/foo'
  target '/tmp/bar'
  notifies :restart, 'service[lsyncd]', :delayed
end
```

## Recipes

### default.rb

Installs lsyncd, creates `/etc/lsyncd/conf.d`, sets up base config, and starts
lsyncd service. Note that the service will not actually start until you have a sync config in place.

## Attributes

```ruby
default[:lsyncd][:conf_d] = '/etc/lsyncd/conf.d'
default[:lsyncd][:log_file] = '/var/log/lsyncd.log'
default[:lsyncd][:status_file] = '/var/log/lsyncd-status.log'
default[:lsyncd][:interval] = 20
```

## Testing

This cookbook includes chefspec unit tests and integration tests via test-kitchen and serverspec.
There is a test cookbook to exercise the lsync_target LWRP included.

I've included a custom matcher for chefspec. The methods available are:

- `create_lsyncd_target`
- `delete_lsyncd_target`

There is also an `lsyncd_target` chef_runner method, so you can do things like:

```ruby
resource = chef_run.lsyncd_target('test1')
expect(resource).to notify('service[lsyncd]').to(:restart).delayed
```
